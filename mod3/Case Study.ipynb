    "# Write a Python app that has the following classes:\n",
    "1. A super class called Vehicle, which contains an attribute for vehicle type, such as car, truck, plane, boat, or a broomstick.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. A class called Automobile which will inherit the attributes from Vehicle and also contain the following attributes:\n",

    "year\n",
