    "This chapter introduced the atoms of Python: numbers, booleans, and variables. Let’s try a few small exercises with them in the interactive interpreter.\n",

    "3.2 Assign the result from the previous task (seconds in an hour) to a variable called seconds_per_hour.\n",

    "3.3 How many seconds are in a day? Use your seconds_per_hour variable.\n",

    "3.4 Calculate seconds per day again, but this time save the result in a variable called seconds_per_day.\n",

    "3.5 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour. Use floating-point (/) division.\n",
    "\n",
    "3.6 Divide seconds_per_day by seconds_per_hour, using integer (//) division. Did this number agree with the floating-point value from the previous question, aside from the final .0?"
